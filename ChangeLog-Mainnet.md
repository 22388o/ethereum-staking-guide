#### All Guides

##### General
- Adjusted case on CTRL+X/C from upper to lower (CTRL+C -> CTRL+c) to address minor confusion around capitalization.

##### Geth
- Added new section: **Check Connected Peers**. Demonstrates usage of `net.peerCount` which returns the number of peers connected to the Geth client.
